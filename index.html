      Hi! My name is Vermont Garcia, I'm Mexican and I have been living in the US for the last 5 years.
      I have a curious mind always in learning mode, whether it's picking up a new skill or diving into a good book.
      Loyal to a fault and always up for a good laugh. Sports are my therapy, and I love staying active.

    <p>Utah is a state located in the Mountain West region of the United States. It’s one of the Four Corners states, where it meets Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. To its north, it borders Wyoming and Idaho, while to the west, it shares a boundary with Nevada. People from Utah are called Utahns. More than half of the population are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has its global headquarters in Salt Lake City. Utah is the only state where a majority of people belong to a single religious group. The LDS Church plays a major role in shaping the culture, politics, and daily life of the state.</p>
